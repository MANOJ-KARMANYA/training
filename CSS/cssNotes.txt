Interview Question:-

1. what are types of css?
2. how many ways you can use css?
3. there are three ways to use css?
    i. inline css :- In the html file we use style as a attribute here, (in the start tag inself with properties and value).
    ii. internal css :- In the html file we use style tag and in that we write css code. 
                        syntax: 
                        selector {
                            peoperty:value;
                            peoperty:value;
                            peoperty:value;
                        }
    iii. external css :- In this we create a seperate css file and that we import in the html file by using link tag. 
                        with a extention of .css (as a css seperate file)
                    syntax: 
                        selector {
                            peoperty:value;
                            peoperty:value;
                            peoperty:value;
                        }

4. selector in css : selecting an element
    i. element name selector: in this we use element name to apply css property 
                     element {
                            peoperty:value;
                            peoperty:value;
                     }
    ii. group selector:we can make a group selectors name 
                         element1,element2,element3,  {
                            peoperty:value;
                            peoperty:value;
                     }
